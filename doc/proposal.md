3 Motivation and Scope
==========================================================================
Database desgin and access has seen many diffent approches with a wide
varity of concerns accross domains. Many of these approches try to follow
some sort of guidlines to support introportablity. While this can support
many resuable models, the requiremenst of these guidlines will not
statisfy all needs. This can be seen with small changes seen through many
almost identical products and apis. This library attempts to outline some
of the most basic differnces between differnt data models used. This is
used to create common interfaces that can be used to access specfic
funcality of the underlying database.
